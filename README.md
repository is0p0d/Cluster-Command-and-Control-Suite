# Cluster Command and Control Suite - C3


## ASEC

This repository was formerly named "ASEC" - Affordable Student Education Clusters. It comprised the beginnings of the research I was conducting for the late Dr. Stephen L. Scott at Tennessee Tech University as part of the preamble to a Master's thesis.

The idea with ASEC was to create a very light weight and open cluster command software suite with the goal of being easy to implement and modify for students working in an academic lab environment. Ideally allowing students to have small affordable clusters comprised of SBC systems or low end hardware to have a more "bare metal" experience than partitioning time on a given institutions more professionally managed cluster - if one was available. 
We decided to use the software suite developed by Dr. Scott and his team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), **Cluster Command and Control Suite (C3)** as a base for ASEC as it had depreciated over the past 20 years, but still showed promise for what we desired to do.

## C3

After the death of Dr. Scott in late 2022, this project is no longer being pursued actively for academic purposes. I have decided to make the repository public and rename it back to C3 so that it may be found easily with a little bit of searching to anyone who may be looking for it. The current version uploaded is **4.0.1**, released July 15th 2003, which was the last update directly maintained by the original maintainers of the project. Later versions exist but had some hacky components to accomodate package managers and the like, I consider 4.0.1 to be the last "pure" C3 version.

*This version of C3 requires python2.*

Since I started this research, ORNL has taken down all the legacy websites for projects like C3, its parent project OSCAR (Open Source Cluster Administration Resources), and the machines it was developed on such as TORC AND HighTORC. With these sites being taken down, much of the version history for these software suites and the general development history around them has been lost as well. When time permits, I will be working to upload doucmentation and context that I have saved on C3 to my website, which I will update this document with a link to when I set that up.

## Future 

Though I am updating this readme now and not contributing much to the project itself, I do plan to eventually continue the research I had set out to complete with Dr. Scott. I will be updating my website with not only progress on this but also trying to find archives and eventually recreate the documentation and history that was originally provided by the C3, OSCAR, and TORC websites through ORNL.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, or information/experiences with C3, I'd love to hear it.



*Rest in peace, Dr. Scott, your insight and mentorship had more profound of an impact on me than I could ever put into words.*
